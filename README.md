## Overview

The code provided herein constitutes the core implementation of **Belief Propagation (BP)**, a widely used algorithm in graphical models, particularly in machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. Belief Propagation is a message-passing algorithm used to perform inference on probabilistic graphical models.

### Current Available Components

The currently available code includes the fundamental components of the Belief Propagation algorithm, such as:
- Core algorithmic implementation

### Pending Updates

Additional auxiliary code, including but not limited to data preprocessing, visualization tools, and extended utilities, will be made available once the code is refactored for improved readability and usability. We plan to provide these supplementary components in the near future and will update the repository accordingly.
